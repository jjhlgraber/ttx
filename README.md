# ttx
A deterministic and a stochastic computational model of membrane voltage of cells, based on expansions of the Huxley-Hodgekin equations. It is used to study the effect of the neurotoxin Tetrodotoxine on the membrane voltage and therefore signaling behavior of cells with different genetic variants of the sodium channel.

I will add a better description when I find the time. For now, see TTX_report.pdf
